# NOTES 250627
**You’re crushing it! Here’s what comes next:**

---

## **2. (Optional but Smart) Test the Build**

* If TestFlight:

  * Add your Apple account as a tester.
  * Upload the .ipa to App Store Connect (EAS will often do this automatically).
  * Test the app on a real device!
* If you run into any “missing permissions” or “build failed” errors, ping me for a fix.

---

## **3. Push and Tag Your Work**

* After a successful build, **tag your repo**:

  ```sh
  git tag v1.3.1_eas-build-success
  git push --tags
  ```
* This locks in your working EAS setup for future reference.

---

## **4. Start Your Next Big Sprint or Phase**

**You are now ready to:**

* Tackle UI/UX polish (with the Cursor block we set up)
* Experiment with glass morphism or new theme overlays—on a safe staging/dev branch
* Add any final features or deep-link integrations
* Prepare for “pre-launch” or final QA (if you’re nearing release)

---

## **5. Bonus:**

* **Want to automate post-build smoke tests?**
  Add a test script or a checklist (`/tasks/eas-build-checklist.md`).

* **Want to invite beta testers?**
  Add them to your TestFlight group in App Store Connect.

---

## **What Do Most Teams Do Next?**

* Polish UI, accessibility, and onboarding flows.
* Add any final “must-have” features.
* Run a “final QA” sprint and prep store listing/screenshots.

---

**Let me know which phase you want to focus on next**:

* UI polish (finish, then glass morphism)
* Deep linking/Siri shortcuts
* StoreKit/premium
* Release prep/QA
* Or another experimental feature

I’ll prep the Cursor/automation blocks or checklists you need!

**What’s your priority?**
