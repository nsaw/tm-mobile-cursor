# 🚀 **src-nextgen/ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
## **B + D + E Strategy: Clean Rebuild + Dual-Mount + Hybrid Shell**

**Generated**: 2025-07-19T09:30:00.000Z  
**Strategy**: src-reference/ → Clean Rebuild + Dual-Mount + Hybrid Renderer Shell  
**Status**: Ready for Phase 0 implementation with comprehensive safety measures

---

## 🎯 **KEY FINDINGS**

### **Strategy Overview: B + D + E**
The **B + D + E strategy** combines the best approaches:

1. **B: src-reference/ → Clean Rebuild** - Legacy backup, cherry-pick working components
2. **D: Dual-Mount Architecture** - Test nextgen alongside legacy via environment toggle
3. **E: Hybrid Renderer Shell** - Gradual migration with role-based wrappers

### **Strategic Advantages**
- **No destructive overwrite** - Legacy remains functional
- **Safe testing environment** - Dual-mount enables parallel testing
- **Gradual migration path** - Shell structure enables controlled transition
- **Ultimate safety net** - src-reference/ provides complete rollback capability
- **Production safety** - No disruption to existing functionality

---

## 🧩 **SCREEN MOUNT TYPES BREAKDOWN**

### **Structural Triad for Phase 2**

#### **1. src-nextgen/ → Full Dual-Routing Screens**
```
✅ PURPOSE: Screens using full dual-routing capabilities
✅ USAGE: High-traffic screens that need complete nextgen implementation
✅ EXAMPLES:
- DashboardScreen.tsx → src-nextgen/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx
- HomeScreen.tsx → src-nextgen/screens/HomeScreen.tsx
- ThoughtmarkDetailScreen.tsx → src-nextgen/screens/ThoughtmarkDetailScreen.tsx
- SearchScreen.tsx → src-nextgen/screens/SearchScreen.tsx
- AllBinsScreen.tsx → src-nextgen/screens/AllBinsScreen.tsx

✅ VALIDATION: Must have snapshot + interaction tests in both legacy and nextgen environments
```

#### **2. src/shell/ → Shared Infrastructure & Sacred Views**
```
✅ PURPOSE: Shared wrappers, sacred views, and role-based infrastructure
✅ USAGE: Components that must remain consistent across both environments
✅ EXAMPLES:
- Role-based wrappers (AutoRoleView, etc.)
- Layout contracts and navigation definitions
- Sacred view mounts (BottomNav, Onboarding)
- Authentication components (SignIn, SignUp, PINEntry)
- Settings components (Profile, Content, Export)

✅ VALIDATION: Must be imported by both legacy and nextgen, never recreated
```

#### **3. src-reference/ → Legacy Cherry-Pick Source**
```
✅ PURPOSE: Legacy codebase to cherry-pick working components from
✅ USAGE: Source for transplanting sacred fragments and working logic
✅ EXAMPLES:
- Working component implementations
- Proven business logic
- Stable utility functions
- Tested navigation patterns

✅ VALIDATION: Read-only reference, never modified directly
```

---

## 🛡️ **SACRED VIEW INJECTION POLICY**

### **Sacred Views Must Be Mounted Once in src/shell/**
```
✅ SACRED VIEWS (Never Change):
- BottomNav.tsx → src/shell/navigation/BottomNav.tsx
- Onboarding components → src/shell/onboarding/
- Core navigation logic → src/shell/navigation/
- Authentication flows → src/shell/auth/

✅ INJECTION POLICY:
- These are mounted once in src/shell/
- Any src-nextgen route must import these from shell, not recreate them
- This guarantees sacred consistency across both environments
- No duplicate implementations allowed

✅ VALIDATION:
- Single source of truth for sacred views
- Import validation in CI pipeline
- No sacred view recreation in src-nextgen/
- Consistency checks between legacy and nextgen
```

---

## 🔌 **PATCH-RUNNER AUTOMATION POLICY**

### **Automated Hybrid Block Enforcement**
```
✅ PATCH NAMING CONVENTIONS:
- Format: patch-1.4.1e-{phase}-{step}_{description}.json
- Examples:
  - patch-1.4.1e-1-3e_src-nextgen-init.json
  - patch-1.4.1e-2-1c_dashboard-init.json
  - patch-1.4.1e-2-2c_shell-auth-migration.json

✅ VALIDATION GATES (Non-Negotiable):
- All validation gates must trigger before every commit
- tsc --noEmit (TypeScript validation)
- { { { { npm run lint:guard (ESLint validation) & &  & } >/dev/null 2>&1 & disown & } >/dev/null 2>&1 & disown} >/dev/null 2>&1 & disown} >/dev/null 2>&1 & disown
- Visual regression testing (both legacy and nextgen)
- Performance impact measurement
- Accessibility compliance check
- Runtime error detection
- Dual-mount toggle validation

✅ SUMMARY CROSS-REFERENCING:
- All .md summaries must cross-reference the relevant patch + roadmap phase
- Patch summaries written to /mobile-native-fresh/tasks/summaries/
- Executive summaries must reference specific patches
- Strategy analysis must include patch impact assessment
```

---

## 🔎 **CI PARALLEL TESTING ENFORCEMENT**

### **Non-Negotiable Dual Environment Testing**
```
✅ MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:
- Every screen migrated to src-nextgen must have snapshot + interaction tests in both environments
- These are NOT optional - they're what make dual-mount viable as a safety net
- Legacy environment testing must remain functional
- Nextgen environment testing must validate new implementations

✅ TESTING FRAMEWORK:
- Snapshot testing for both legacy and nextgen
- Interaction testing for both environments
- Visual regression testing for both modes
- Performance testing for both implementations
- Accessibility testing for both versions

✅ CI PIPELINE:
- Parallel test execution for legacy and nextgen
- Automated comparison between environments
- Performance regression detection
- Visual regression detection
- Accessibility compliance validation

✅ FAILURE HANDLING:
- Stop all automation on validation failure
- Revert to last known good state
- Document the failure point
- Create targeted fix before continuing
```

## 🎯 **CONCLUSION**

The **B + D + E strategy** combines the best approaches:
- **B**: Clean rebuild from src-reference/ (most defensible)
- **D**: Dual-mount architecture (enables safe testing)
- **E**: Hybrid renderer shell (controlled transition)

This approach **avoids the 4x rollback failures** by:
1. **Incremental migration** - never mass replacement
2. **Performance monitoring** - AutoRoleView overhead is real
3. **Debug controls** - debug systems can overwhelm
4. **Validation gates** - test after every change
5. **Rollback strategy** - plan for failure scenarios
6. **Dual-mount safety** - test nextgen alongside legacy

**The AutoRoleView system itself is sound** - the failure was in the **implementation approach**. With proper incremental migration, role analysis, performance monitoring, and safety measures, src-nextgen/ can be successfully implemented.

**Success depends on following the lessons learned from the 4x rollback failures while leveraging the B + D + E strategy.**

**Status**: ✅ Analysis Complete  
**Strategy**: B + D + E (Clean Rebuild + Dual-Mount + Hybrid Shell)
