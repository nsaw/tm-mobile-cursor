# Patch Delivery Proof Policy

## Rules

For each dispatched patch:

- Cursor must log:
 - Cursor must log (absolute paths, NB-runner bounded):
  - 📨 File creation in `patches/`
  - 📬 Receipt pickup confirmation (agent log or relay)
  - 🏁 Execution log output
  - 📄 Matching `.summary.md` created

If any step is missing (or logs absent under `validations/logs/`):
  - Patch is invalid
  - GPT must retry or mark patch `unverified`

**Status**: ✅ **ENFORCED - CRITICAL**
**Compliance**: Zero tolerance with automatic violation detection
**Scope**: All operations across all contexts
