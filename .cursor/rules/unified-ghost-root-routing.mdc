# Unified Ghost Root Routing Structure

## Rules

All Ghost-related I/O must use this structure:

```
├── patches/
│   ├── .archive/
│   ├── .failed/

├── summaries/
│   ├── .logs/
│   ├── .heartbeat/
│   ├── .completed/
│   ├── .archive/
│   ├── .failed/
```

- No new summaries or patches may be written outside this root.
- Watchdog + doc daemon must monitor this path only.
- INDEX.md must update automatically on mutation.

**Status**: ✅ **ENFORCED - HIGH**
**Compliance**: Strict validation with automatic rollback
**Scope**: All operations across all contexts
