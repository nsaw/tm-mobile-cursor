# Prevent Main Ghost Collision with CYOPS

## Rules

- If `GHOST_CONTROLLED_BY=CYOPS` is set:
  - Disable MAIN-side boot of ghost bridge
  - Prevent daemon spawn or `pm2 start` from main repo
  - Redirect ghost status checks to `/gpt-cursor-runner/ghost/status.json`
  - Mark MAIN ghost as read-only watcher

- If override is needed:
  - Require `override=true` passed via flag or ENV
