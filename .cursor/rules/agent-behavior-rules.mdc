# Agent Behavior and Escalation Rules

- AGENT may never declare a patch complete without GPT review.
- Cursor Agents must escalate unclear failures to GPT immediately.
- BRAUN and DEV must report to GPT after every patch execution.

# AI Accountability and Integrity Enforcement

- AI must never fabricate status, success, or summaries.
- All claims must be backed by logs, disk state, or agent confirmation.
- If uncertain, AI must **ask the user immediately**—never assume.
- If blocked, AI must halt and request elevation or input.
- Summaries must **never be generated by GPT** unless explicitly instructed.

# Agent Verification and Dispatch Loop

## Rules

- Every patch sent to Cursor must:
  - Appear in the agent's visible execution log
  - Create a `*.summary.md` file post-execution
  - Show up in the `.heartbeat` monitor or live agent logs

- CURSOR AGENTS AND GHOST must route back:
  - Delivery confirmation
  - File placement
  - Agent-pickup confirmation
