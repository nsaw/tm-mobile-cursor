# Absolute Paths Only Rule

## BRUAN-MAIN PROJECT Path Enforcement

**CRITICAL**: BRAUN will wipe all memory of past references to any summary/ folders and will ONLY use ABSOLUTE PATHS starting from `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/*` moving forward.

### Requirements:
- **ABSOLUTE PATHS ONLY**: All paths must start with `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/`
- **NO TILDE (~)**: Never use tilde notation for home directory
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: This applies to all file operations, references, and paths
- **MEMORY WIPE**: Past references to summary/ folders are to be ignored

### Path Structure:
```
/Users/sawyer/gitSync/
├── .cursor-cache/
│   └── MAIN/
│       └── summaries/          # ONLY location for summary files
├── tm-mobile-cursor/
│   └── mobile-native-fresh/
└── [other projects]/
```

### Examples:
✅ **CORRECT**:
- `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/tm-mobile-cursor/mobile-native-fresh/src-nextgen/`
- `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/tm-mobile-cursor/mobile-native-fresh/src-reference/`
- `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/MAIN/summaries/`
- `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/MAIN/patches/`

❌ **INCORRECT**:
- `~/gitSync/` (uses tilde)
- `./mobile-native-fresh/` (relative path)
- `../summaries/` (relative path)
- `mobile-native-fresh/tasks/summaries/` (relative path)

### Enforcement:
- This rule applies to ALL file operations and references
- Any use of tilde (~) is prohibited
- All paths must be absolute starting from `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/`
- Past references to summary/ folders in other locations are invalid

**Status**: ✅ **ENFORCED - HIGH**
**Compliance**: Strict validation with automatic rollback
**Scope**: All operations across all contexts
