# Summary File Path Enforcement

## BRUAN-MAIN PROJECT Summary File Rule

**CRITICAL**: All future .md files (such as summaries) created by BRUAN-MAIN PROJECT must be written EXCLUSIVELY to:

```
/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/MAIN/summaries
```

### Requirements:
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: All summary files must use this exact path
- **ABSOLUTE PATHS ONLY**: Never use relative paths or shortcuts
- **NO TILDE (~)**: Never use tilde notation for home directory
- **EXCLUSIVE LOCATION**: No other summary/ folders should be used

### Examples:
✅ **CORRECT**:
- `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/MAIN/summaries/patch-summary.md`
- `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/MAIN/summaries/phase-completion.md`

❌ **INCORRECT**:
- `~/gitSync/summaries/` (uses tilde)
- `./summaries/` (relative path)
- `mobile-native-fresh/tasks/summaries/` (wrong location)
- `MAIN/patches/summaries/` (wrong location)

### Enforcement:
- This rule applies to ALL summary files created by BRUAN-MAIN PROJECT
- Any deviation from this path structure is prohibited
- All summary files must be written to the exact specified location
