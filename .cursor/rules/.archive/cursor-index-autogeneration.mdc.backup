tags: ["index", "autogeneration", "documentation"]
appliesTo: ["CursorAgent", "Ghost"]
enforce: true
priority: medium

## Rules

- Anytime a `.mdc` or `.json` file is added, moved, or archived:
  - Rebuild `INDEX.md` as table of contents
  - Regenerate `README.md` with purpose, structure, and usage

- Use consistent structure:
  - Group by phase or intent
  - Include links to `.completed/`, `.failed/`, and `.archive/`
