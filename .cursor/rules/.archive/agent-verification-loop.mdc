# Agent Verification and Dispatch Loop

## Rules

- Every patch sent to Cursor must:
  - Appear in the agent's visible execution log
  - Create a `*.summary.md` file post-execution
  - Show up in the `.heartbeat` monitor or live agent logs

- GHOST must route back:
  - Delivery confirmation
  - File placement
  - Agent-pickup confirmation
