enforce: true
priority: high

## Rules

- No GPT-generated block may run without a matching:
  - `.summary.md`
  - Patch ID + version label
  - Proof of dispatch and execution

- If GPT executes a fix or runs validation outside of a patch, it must:
  - Emit logs or a stub summary
  - Report action to user in this chat
  - Track runtime via `/summaries/.heartbeat/`
