appliesTo: ["CursorAgent", "Ghost"]
enforce: true
priority: high

## Rules

- All agents (DEV, BRAUN) must:
  - Prove daemonized state via pm2 or launchd logs
  - Show active registration in `.heartbeat/` and `.logs/`
  - Publish daemon PID or health report on startup
  - Auto-recover if stuck, zombie, or missing patches

- Missing daemons must alert GPT and trigger `fallback-repair.sh`
