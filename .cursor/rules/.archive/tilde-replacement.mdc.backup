# Tilde Replacement Rule

## Global Tilde Replacement Enforcement

**CRITICAL**: Tilde linking will be grepped and replaced globally in all projects and relentlessly replaced with `/Users/sawyer/`.

### Requirements:
- **GLOBAL REPLACEMENT**: All tilde (~) usage must be replaced with `/Users/sawyer/`
- **RELENTLESS ENFORCEMENT**: No exceptions or allowances for tilde usage
- **ALL PROJECTS**: This applies to all projects in the workspace
- **AUTOMATIC DETECTION**: Tilde usage should be identified and corrected immediately

### Replacement Pattern:
```
~ → /Users/sawyer
```

### Examples:
✅ **CORRECT** (After Replacement):
- `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/tm-mobile-cursor/`
- `/Users/sawyer/.config/`
- `/Users/sawyer/Documents/`

❌ **INCORRECT** (Before Replacement):
- `~/gitSync/tm-mobile-cursor/`
- `~/.config/`
- `~/Documents/`

### File Types Affected:
- All source code files
- Configuration files
- Documentation files
- Script files
- Any file containing path references

### Enforcement Process:
1. **DETECT**: Identify any tilde (~) usage in files
2. **REPLACE**: Immediately replace with `/Users/sawyer/`
3. **VERIFY**: Ensure all replacements are complete
4. **PREVENT**: Block any new tilde usage

### Search Patterns:
```bash
# Find all tilde usage
grep -r "~" /Users/sawyer/gitSync/

# Replace tilde with absolute path
sed -i '' 's|~|/Users/sawyer|g' [files]
```

### Compliance:
- This rule is MANDATORY for all file operations
- No exceptions for tilde usage
- All paths must use absolute paths starting with `/Users/sawyer/`
- Continuous monitoring and replacement required
