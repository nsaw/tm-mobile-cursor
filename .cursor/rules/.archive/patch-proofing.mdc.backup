# Patch Validation and Proof Requirements
tags: ["patches", "validation", "proof"]
appliesTo: ["GPT", "CursorAgent", "Ghost"]
enforce: true
priority: critical

## Rules

- No patch is marked complete unless:
  - Logs prove validation
  - Summary is confirmed and visible on disk
  - Agent reports successful runtime behavior

- GPT must never close a patch cycle without running all:
  - Lint, TypeScript, test, performance, runtime, and role checks
