enforce: true
priority: critical

## Rules

- No patch is marked complete unless:
  - Logs prove validation
  - Summary is confirmed and visible on disk
  - Agent reports successful runtime behavior

- GPT must never close a patch cycle without running all:
  - Lint, TypeScript, test, performance, runtime, and role checks
