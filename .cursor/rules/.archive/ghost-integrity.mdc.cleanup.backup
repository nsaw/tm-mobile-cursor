# Ghost Runner Integrity and Routing Validation

appliesTo: ["Ghost", "CursorAgent"]
enforce: true

## Rules

- All Ghost dispatches must:
  - Be confirmed via logs and `/summaries/_heartbeat/`
  - Return validation proof via summary and status ping
  - Use a single `.cursor-cache` location for all routing if consolidated

- Ghost must not run duplicate daemon processes across MAIN or CYOPS.
- Orchestrator PID files must be unique and verified on live scan.
