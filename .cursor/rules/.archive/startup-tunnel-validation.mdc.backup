enforce: true
priority: high

## Rules

On `ghost-bridge` or `orchestrator.js` launch:

- Confirm:
  - Ngrok or Cloudflare tunnel is active
  - Port forwarding to `/ghost/status.json` is accessible
  - `curl` healthcheck passes

If not:
- Do not mark startup as successful
- Restart after 5s with backoff
