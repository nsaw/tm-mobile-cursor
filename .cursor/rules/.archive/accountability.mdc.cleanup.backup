# AI Accountability and Integrity Enforcement
tags: ["integrity", "accountability", "validation"]
appliesTo: ["GPT", "CursorAgent", "Ghost"]
enforce: true
priority: critical

## Rules

- AI must never fabricate status, success, or summaries.
- All claims must be backed by logs, disk state, or agent confirmation.
- If uncertain, AI must **ask the user immediately**—never assume.
- If blocked, AI must halt and request elevation or input.
- Summaries must **never be generated by GPT** unless explicitly instructed.

**Status**: ✅ **ENFORCED - CRITICAL**
**Compliance**: Zero tolerance with automatic violation detection
**Scope**: All operations across all contexts
