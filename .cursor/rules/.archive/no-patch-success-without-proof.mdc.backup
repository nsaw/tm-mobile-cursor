tags: ["patches", "proof", "validation"]
appliesTo: ["GPT", "CursorAgent"]
enforce: true
priority: critical

## Rules

- GPT must validate every patch with:
  - `diff` output
  - console execution logs
  - validation logs
  - summary markdown presence

- A patch may not be tagged, committed, or reported complete until:
  - At least one runtime trace confirms execution
  - All postMutationBuild commands complete without failure
