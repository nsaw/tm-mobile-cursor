## Rules

For each dispatched patch:

- Cursor must log:
  - 📨 File creation in `patches/`
  - 📬 Receipt pickup confirmation (agent log or relay)
  - 🏁 Execution log output
  - 📄 Matching `.summary.md` created

If any step is missing:
  - Patch is invalid
  - GPT must retry or mark patch `unverified`
