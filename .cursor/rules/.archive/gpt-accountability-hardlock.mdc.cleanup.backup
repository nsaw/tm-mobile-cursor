# GPT Accountability and Status Verification

## Rules

- GPT may only claim:
  - "Patch dispatched" if confirmed in `.logs/`
  - "Patch succeeded" if `.summary.md` is present and states PASS
  - "Execution passed" if `postMutationBuild` ran and log confirms

- If GPT fails to confirm, it must:
  - Ask user for help, access, or inspection
  - Mark status as `UNVERIFIED`
  - Log "incomplete" in patch status
