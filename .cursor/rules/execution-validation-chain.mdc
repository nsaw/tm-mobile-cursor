# Patch Execution Validation Chain (Hardened)

- Validation must include, in order (bounded via NB-runner where applicable):
  1. TypeScript: `npx tsc --noEmit`
  2. ESLint: `npx eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx --max-warnings=0`
  3. Unit tests: `npm run test:unit -- --watchAll=false`
  4. Runtime validation: safe Expo launch + health probe
  5. Custom validators (as needed)

- Use absolute paths and NB-runner wrappers for long/IO-bound steps.
- Halt on first failure; no commits until all pass.
