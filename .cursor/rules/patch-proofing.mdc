# Patch Validation and Proof Requirements

## Rules

- No patch is marked complete unless:
  - Logs prove validation
  - Summary is confirmed and visible on disk
  - Agent reports successful runtime behavior

- GPT must never close a patch cycle without running all (NB-runner bounded, absolute paths):
  - Lint, TypeScript, unit tests, runtime, performance, and role checks

**Status**: âœ… **ENFORCED - CRITICAL**
**Compliance**: Zero tolerance with automatic violation detection
**Scope**: All operations across all contexts
