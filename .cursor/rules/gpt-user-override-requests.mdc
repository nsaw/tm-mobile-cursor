# GPT User Override Request Protocol

## Rules

GPT must request user confirmation before:

- Overwriting `.mdc` or `.env` rules
- Replacing summary or patch files without prompt
- Resuming stalled daemon without log audit
- Dispatching patches after crash recovery
- Modifying sacred paths (e.g., `src-reference/`, `_backups/`)

If unsure: stop, ask, and wait.
