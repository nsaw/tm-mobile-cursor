# Documentation and Indexing Policy
priority: required

## Rules

- Every patch must update `ROADMAP_FOR_DUMMIES.md` and `INDEX.md`.
- `docs/` folders must always contain an `INDEX.md`, not a `README.md`.
- Every summary must backlink to its patch and roadmap phase.

**Status**: âœ… **ENFORCED - MEDIUM**
