# Ghost Stall Detection and Alerting

## Rules

- GHOST must trigger alerts if:
  - Patch queue is stagnant > 30s
  - No agent pickup is logged within 60s
  - A `.summary.md` fails to appear in `/summaries/` or `.completed/` after dispatch

- All fails must result in:
  - `.failed/` log entry
  - Slack, terminal, or file-level error message
  - GPT notification prompt to reroute or request recovery
