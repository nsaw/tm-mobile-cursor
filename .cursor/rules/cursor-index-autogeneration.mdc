# Cursor Index Auto-Generation

## Rules

- Anytime a `.mdc` or `.json` file is added, moved, or archived:
  - Rebuild `INDEX.md` as table of contents
  - Regenerate `README.md` with purpose, structure, and usage

- Use consistent structure:
  - Group by phase or intent
  - Include links to `.completed/`, `.failed/`, and `.archive/`

**Status**: âœ… **ENFORCED - HIGH**
**Compliance**: Strict validation with automatic rollback
**Scope**: All operations across all contexts
